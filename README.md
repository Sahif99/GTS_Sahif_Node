Welcome to the NODE.Js CRUD REST API Project


You can able to see the folders in which there is node-module file is present, since it is not that much large, so you need not to install node packages.
App folder has database, controller & mongodb schema.
If you want to see the APIs then you have to go through the routes folder & for upgradation in APIs, you have to go to the controller folder.

To see the responses of the APIs, kindly run the localhost by "npm start" & run the swagger API Docs by running "http://localhost:2468/api-docs" in browser.
Since I did authentication work in the project, you have to register youself first & then by logging in you will get the JWT. 
With this token you will able to access all the private APIs & will able to see the responses.

By giving wrong inputs, you will able to see all the validation like salary should not be negative, start date must precedes the end date as weel as the date format validation.

If you want to see how I created API Docs then simply go through the APIRouter & scroll a bit.

I am pasting some info below here:
